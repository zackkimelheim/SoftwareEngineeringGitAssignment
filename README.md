⋅⋅⋅ I like to follow Mayuko on Youtube. She is a Product Software Engineer in Silicon Valley, and she documents her life in the form of Vlogging. For aspiring engineers like myself, it is really cool and important to sort of see through her lens, and it is a no-frills, truly authentic viewpoint on what it is like being an engineer on a daily basis. What she likes. What she doesn't like. She documents it all honestly. It helps put in to perspective what Software Engineers "really" do day-to-day. She also talks a lot about how she got to where she is, and she often offers advice on how to get to her level, which is also very important.

I also found this very interesting. I apreciate Mayuko's honesty in her documentaries.
